jQuery latLonSelector is a simple jQuery plugin to enable Yelp-style floating
elements that follow you as you scroll down the page. Yes they can be kind of
annoying, but I think they can be useful in certain contexts.

jQuery makes this so simple that it's almost easier to just write your own,
but I'm lazy, so I figure others might be too.

Usage:
  $('#some_div').fixedFollower();

Requirements:
  jQuery
